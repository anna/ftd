      <div id="description"><p>Luther "Ticky" Burden was a <a href="http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Ticky-Burden-s-rise-fall-and-rise-3897542.php">professional basketball player</a> with the New York Knicks from 1976-77. In 1981, he was convicted of taking part in a bank robbery. In 1984, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/31/sports/retrial-ordered-for-burden-ex-knick.html">that conviction was overturned</a> when the New York State Supreme Court ruled his home had been illegally searched without a warrant. He later pled guilty to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/03/sports/sports-people-burden-pleads-guilty.html">possession of $400</a> of the stolen money. He <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/sports/basketball/luther-burden-former-knick-who-served-time-for-bank-robbery-dies-at-62.html">died in November 2015</a> in Winston-Salem.</p>

<p>In July 1980, shortly after his arrest, the FBI wrote to the United States Attorney in Eastern District of New York to report that an Assistant US Attorney had declined to federally prosecute Burden, in favor of local prosecution. That letter, which made up the entirety of Burden's released FBI file, is reproduced below.</p></div>
